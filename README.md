# Wedding Anniversary Calculator

A simple app used to calculate obscure wedding anniversaries (such as 10 million seconds, or 1000 days).

## Usage

[Go to the site](https://tightsight.github.io/AnniversaryCalculator/index.html), enter the date you got married, and marvel at the anniversaries you never knew existed.

The first time you enter your anniversary it will give you a link so you can go directly to you anniversaries page in the future.

## TODO

There are lots of features/improvements I would like to add:

* Live timer for how long you have been married (days, seconds, etc).
* Be able to see past anniversaries.
* Split the app to work for birthdays (or any anniversary - work, friends, kids, etc).
* Add more anniversaries, such as Pi years, or "speed of light" seconds.
* Negative anniversaries for people who are not yet married (very important).
* Eventually a way to signup and receive notifications when an anniversary is about to occur.
* Disclaimer for dates before Unix time (Thursday January 1st, 1970), which won't work.
