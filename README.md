# Wedding Anniversary Calculator

A simple app used to calculate obscure wedding anniversaries (such as 10 million seconds, or 1000 days).

## Usage

Go to the site, enter the date you got married, and marvel at the anniversaries you never knew existed.

The first time you enter your anniversary it will give you a link so you can go directly to you anniversaries page in the future.

## TODO

There are lots of features I would like to add:

* Live timer for how long you have been married (days, seconds, etc).
* Negative anniversaries for people who are not yet married (very important).
* Eventually a way to signup and receive notifications when an anniversary is about to occur.
